Macroinvertebrate / Fish Ecology Group Repository
We hypothesize that due to macroinvertebratesâ€™ role as a major food source for stream fish, fish diversity and macroinvertebrate diversity are directly correlated regardless of geographic location.
Data main points: Macroinvertebrate species count per month, fish species count per month. Site geographic data; precipitation? Average temperature? Elevation?
